## GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS
### GAMEPLAY CONCEPTS / RULES 
BlackJack (also known as 21) is a simple card game that uses a deck of 52 standard playing cards. You verse the dealer (your computer) with the goal of getting cards as close, but not greator then or equal to 21. Initally both the dealer and player receive two cards. The sum of the cards is equal to the number, ie:
a `Two of Spades` = 2
and a `Seven of Hearts` = 7.
This gives a total of `2 + 7` = 9. Alphabetical cards such as a `King`, `Queen` or `Jack` are all equal 10. An `Ace` is equal to 1 or 11 depending on what benefits the player.

### GAMEPLAY IN MATLAB
After running the program within `BlackJack.m`:
- Input the player's name (your name) followed by `enter`/`return` on your keyboard.
- Read outputted text to try and understand the dealer's hand.
- Continue to input the following commands until you are happy with your hand:
  - `1` to hit (receive another card)
  - `2` to stand (finalise your hand).
- Final outcome of the game is revealed. Game can be replayed by pressing `Run`.
